# Knapsack01  

### Whaat?

"The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible."  
  
"The most common problem being solved is the 0-1 knapsack problem, which restricts the number  of copies of each kind of item to zero or one."
